# EasyWorkload

## Project Description
EasyWorkload is a desktop-based Java application meant to assist students in managing their workload. It features a to-do task list, a calendar for a 'bird's eye view' of a student's workload, task completion progress, a daily to-do list generator, and regular notificatons to remind students on their uncompleted tasks. The primary objective is to provide the student an easy, streamlined way to manage their workload efficiently.

*This project was made in fulfillment of the requirements in CSCI42 Software Engineering at Ateneo De Manila University during the Second Semester of the school year 2023-2024.*

## Rules for Developers
Please observe the following rules while working on the project:
1. This project runs on Java SE JDK 19 provided by the Oracle Corporation.

3. Strict Git conventions will be observed when performing commits, pushes, and pulls on the repository. Please refer to the **git_conventions.md** file found in the root folder of this repository.
4. **When writing new code, do your work on a separate branch and not work on the main branch.** It is in our best interests to avoid manually merging 100+ files when there's a conflict. That happened to me before and it was not fun. Use your name as the name of your branch.
5. Kindly write proper Java documentation must be observed so those who are unfamiliar about a particular part of the software will have a reference.
6. Observe Java documentation
